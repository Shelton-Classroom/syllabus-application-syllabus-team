Progress
This week I was working on Filter for Courses and Employees.

Issues
For some reason my Visual Studio won't give me the option to add scafold item or views and lot more.
So, that I have not been able to test my codes but I think it'd work because I have used same method in my other class last semester.

Goals
To fix my Visual Studio with the help of professors tomorrow so I can test and finish up filter. Also, work filters on other tables as well.
