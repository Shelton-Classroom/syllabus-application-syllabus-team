Saved Templates to show the team.
Started to think about Color Schemes.
Wanted to contact the team as far as a company name so I can start to think about logos.
Attended optional class so I could get in touch with my team and have them add me to the slack channel.

Met with Lamon for about 10 minutes. 
I sent him some ideas that I had for the Logo.
We agreed on a template. 
I will work on adjusting the contents of the template to fit our needs.
On Monday we will show the team the template and start to build a wire frame.

Stripped the template chosen for the website and added in sections specific to Syllabest.
Will show the team tomorrow to get feedback on what needs to be adjusted/added etc.
Received the logo from Lamon! Looks great - Need to figure out a way to make it bigger without it becoming blurry.

Met with Lamon, Patrick, and Jeff on 1/26/21
Spoke about the layout and color scheme. We want to make sure everything flows and matches so Patrick and Jeff are making adjustments to the brochure.
Talked about the sections we are going to incorporate within the website so it matches the brochure.
Lamon and I spoke about adjustments to the website and logo
I worked on adjustments to the website - Changed background color, changed sections, adding a map and address.

Worked on adding a map to the webpage.
I wanted it to be the width of the web page but could not figure out how to stretch just the width.
Also changed the font size so it's larger.
Worked on the "About section" - I am not adding it in until approved by the team.

Changed the location of the map to the Parham Road Campus
Added a Log In button - I loke the way it looks but I dont like that it brings up the toggle menu the same way the "Menu" button does.
I tinkered with it but the only way I could stop it from showing the menu it lost the format
Added in testimonials and pricing.
I did some research on adding in a download button for the PDF manual. I need to follow up with professor Shelton. She mentioned she had videos she coulld send me.

Met with Prof. Shelton on Wednesday to get the login information to upload the website to the school server. - Note when I deleted the old version and tried to upload the most
most recent version, when I click the link provided it keeps taking me back to the old version...

Tinkered with the Log In button. I attempted to keep the format with out the menu popping up when you click it. I was able to take the menu off and keep the same font style, 
but it was above the menu button that made the height of the nav bar taller - I didnt like the way it looked. When I put in the code to get it on the same row the button was 
still misplaced. I decided to go a simpler route and add it to the menu bar instead.

Read over the information Prof. Shelton sent about the pop up. Due to me using a template it was diffcult for me to pick through all the code for the "fancy box" they used
to make the intended changes. It was also difficult to add in a download button on the "fancy box".I did some reserach and went a slightly different route. 
I created a separate html page for the User Guide and linked it to our home page. When you click the link it redirects you to a page where you can read over and/or download 
the user guide. I am really happy with the way it looks and the download button is already working!! Only thing I would like to change is instead of it redirecting the page 
I want to see if I can get it to create a separate tab.
