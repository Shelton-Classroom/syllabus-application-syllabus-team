Saved Templates to show the team.
Started to think about Color Schemes.
Wanted to contact the team as far as a company name so I can start to think about logos.
Attended optional class so I could get in touch with my team and have them add me to the slack channel.

Met with Lamon for about 10 minutes. 
I sent him some ideas that I had for the Logo.
He will work on this and a color scheme this coming week.
We agreed on a template. 
I will work on adjusting the contants of the template to fit our needs.
On Monday we will show the team the template and start to build a wire frame.
