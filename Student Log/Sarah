Saved Templates to show the team.
Started to think about Color Schemes.
Wanted to contact the team as far as a company name so I can start to think about logos.
Attended optional class so I could get in touch with my team and have them add me to the slack channel.

Met with Lamon for about 10 minutes. 
I sent him some ideas that I had for the Logo.
We agreed on a template. 
I will work on adjusting the contents of the template to fit our needs.
On Monday we will show the team the template and start to build a wire frame.

1/24/21
Stripped the template chosen for the website and added in sections specific to Syllabest.
Will show the team tomorrow to get feedback on what needs to be adjusted/added etc.
Received the logo from Lamon! Looks great - Need to figure out a way to make it bigger without it becoming blurry.

Met with Lamon, Patrick, and Jeff on 1/26/21
Spoke about the layout and color scheme. We want to make sure everything flows and matches so Patrick and Jeff are making adjustments to the brochure.
Talked about the sections we are going to incorporate within the website so it matches the brochure.
Lamon and I spoke about adjustments to the website and logo
I worked on adjustments to the website - Changed background color, changed sections, adding a map and address.

2/7/21
Worked on adding a map to the webpage.
I wanted it to be the width of the web page but could not figure out how to stretch just the width.
Also changed the font size so it's larger.
Worked on the "About section" - I am not adding it in until approved by the team.
