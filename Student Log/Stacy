3/30-4/11/21
Progress:
  Fixed the form display so that it shows the Title and Description once selected
  Met with Amanda and Sarah to fix HTML code so that our colors match the Company Website colors
  Implemented the changes to the _Layout page to change the look of links and the navbar colors
  Met with Bob and Colin to get a better idea of how to save the selections to the database
  Changed the checkbox code to display under edit or create - Saves the changes through the FormCollection and updates the policies
  
Issues:
  The Edit/Create page does not work when you hit Save, I've sent the error to Bob.
  The research I did on the error code says that we are using the same property name twice. I'm going to look into that.
  
Goals:
  Fix the error code, or figure out a way to work around it.
  Produce a sample of the Syllabus!!!

3/22-3/28/21
Progress:
  Added employee credentials to login page for user testing
  Created a controller to select policies for a new syllabus
  Added a view that displays all of the Policies so that an employee can select the policies 
  they want to display on their new syllabus.  This is done using checkboxes.
  Created a button to submit their selection to display it on another page (will eventually be the actual syllabus)
  Added a course search

Issues:
  After selcting the policies, it will only display the PolicyId.
  
Goals: 
  Make the checkbox selection display the Title and the Description
