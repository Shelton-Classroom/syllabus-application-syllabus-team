Issues: I'd like to meet with Sarah or Lamon so that I can get the "Register and Login" to appear on the right side of the nav bar
  I spent a lot of time trying to figure it out, but I'm missing something - I think a fresh set of eyes will be fix it
  
Goals: Discuss with the team what exactly we want on our menu and submenus and where it should take us so that we can nail the the scaffolding down
