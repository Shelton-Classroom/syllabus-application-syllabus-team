Progress:
Started Creating the ERD for the program.
So far I have five entities with primary keys: Institution, Instructors, Administrators, Classes, and Sections.
Each Entity has a couple properties that I think will make the automation process relatively easy.

Issues:
Everytime I compare the mock data to my ERD I see spots I need to modify or add to.
Waiting to meet with Stacy to compare notes for the final ERD. 
Also I haven't heard from Deo at all, and he hasn't joined our slack.

Goals: Finish the ERD.
Populate the server with mock data.
