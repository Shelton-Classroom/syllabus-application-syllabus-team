Progress:
Started Creating the ERD for the program.
Changed Entity table names to singular to match Database coding standards.
So far we have five entities with primary keys: Institution, Instructor, Administrator, Class, and Section.
Each Entity has a couple properties that I think will make the automation process relatively easy.
Have been working with stacy to determine the needs for our ERD

Issues:
Everytime I compare the mock data to my ERD I see spots I need to modify or add to.
Also I haven't heard from Deo at all, and he hasn't joined our slack.

Goals: Finish the ERD.
Populate the server with mock data.
