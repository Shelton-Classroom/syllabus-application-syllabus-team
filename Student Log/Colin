Progress:
Met with Bob and Stacy and finalized our ERD aside from the login.
Met with Stacy and got the final EDMX on both our machines with a functioning login.
Picked a Bootswatch theme with Stacy.
Made a template for each table for microapps to make new and organized data for remaining tables.

Issues:
Waiting on microapps to bring back data for tables.
Waiting to hear back from Stacy about how to relate the login tables to the rest of the ERD.

Goals:
Populate the remaining tables with the data from microapps.
Start making controllers and scaffolding.

2/7/2021
Progress:
Added a .gitignore file and no longer have merge conflicts.

Issues:
Need to meet with Amanda and Bob to talk about how to handle the login portion of the project.

Goals:
Populate tables with data from Patrick and Jeff.



2/6/2021
Progress:
Put tables in the SQL Server. 
Imported the EDMX into Visual Studio.
Made a table value Enumerated.

Issues:
I currently am having a merge conflict with github so I cannot pull the project.

Goals:
Install a .gitignore and see if that fixes the conflict.
Populate the tables on the server, at least enough for testing now.

1/31/2021
Progress:
Discussed requirements for the ERD with Stacy. 
Met with Bob and Stacy, and discussed Bob's syllabus engine, which also uses a database.

Issues:
I need to meet with Amanda to see how she wants the project to function. 
What sort of inputs the Teachers or Administrators need to access, change, keep up to date.

Goals: 
Finish the ERD update SQLDBM to build the tables on the SQL Server, and build the edmx file.

1/24/2021
Progress:
Started Creating the ERD for the program.
Changed Entity table names to singular to match Database coding standards.
So far we have five entities with primary keys: Institution, Instructor, Administrator, Class, and Section.
Each Entity has a couple properties that I think will make the automation process relatively easy.
Have been working with stacy to determine the needs for our ERD

Issues:
Everytime I compare the mock data to my ERD I see spots I need to modify or add to.
Also I haven't heard from Deo at all, and he hasn't joined our slack.

Goals:
Finish the ERD.
Populate the server with mock data.
