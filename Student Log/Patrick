1/18/21  PIG #1    
Patrick Hall
Progress
-Met with Team
-Had an individual meeting with Jeff, the other Micro guy.  We divided up creating some data to put into our database.  The idea being that it would give the programmers options and ideas.
-We discussed a little about the brochure.  We are going to wait a bit to see how the basic web color scheme and make sure it looks the same.
-We are going to make a minute of the Monday meetings so if anyone misses Mondays, they know what went on.  We will alternate these between Jeff and myself.

-I’m getting used to slack.  
-Learning to use Github to help my group know where the micro apps people are.

-We are basically playing the Role of our school Admins. Generally Suppling data to the database.

Issues
-Didn't put my First PIG in the right place
-I’m probably overdoing it with our database and know it will be cut back some areas and some I maybe adding to College Policies
-Must get a sprint agenda setup for Jan 31, not sure what that entails


Goals (Future)
-Meet on Monday and nail down our Agenda 
-Seek out what information/fields we want to add to database
-Support programmers in deciding primary key fields, etc.…
-Further update our database as needed.
